Running Notes:
Run ServerImplementation.
Run Main.

Testing Notes:
For previous sprints tests:
Run ApplicationTest. It is a suite that runs all tests.
For sprint 5 tests:
Run sprint5_test package as a whole. Right click on the package and click on "Coverage as"
and then click on "JUnit Test." All three tests should be able to run automatically.
